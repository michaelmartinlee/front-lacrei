# 🏳️‍🌈 Lacrei Front-End Prototype

---

## 📌 The Challenge

The idea is to develop a registration and profile page that includes login, registration, and a professional profile for Lacrei, aiming to automate the current process and provide a better experience for professionals, encouraging them to register and become partners.

### 🔧 Installation

To **deploy** this application, you need to clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/michaelmartinlee/front-lacrei


Then, install the packages and dependencies:


npm install


### 📋 Features

Our application is intended to be a fully customizable prototype, so we implement best practices in folder architecture:
#
<div style="display: flex">
  <img src="./src/assets/readme/files.png">

* The "assets" folder: Stores all image files

* The "components" folder: Stores all components that are used at least twice in the application

* The "Pages" folder: Contains the entire structure of the pages

* The "Styles" folder: Contains global styles like font, margin, etc.

* In the `Routes.tsx` file, all application routes are defined            
</div>
